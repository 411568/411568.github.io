LM709 is a general purpose op-amp. It's widely used in many applications and it's internal schematic is available in its datasheet. So I thought... why not build one myself... Using SMD transistors and resistors ofc. 
You can check out all of the altium deisgner files (schematic and PCB) on my github [repo](https://github.com/411568/Discrete_LM709). On this page I plan to post the results of the tests we're gonna do and compare this discrete version with the LM709 IC in a number of different configurations.


# Schematic
The schematic and PCB were both designed using Altium Designer
