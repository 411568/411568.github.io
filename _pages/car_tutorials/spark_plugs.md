# How often should you replace your spark plugs
As always, please check your owners manual as it should state how often or after how many kilometers you should replace them. Usually they last about 50k to even over 100k kilometers but if your car has LPG, 
it is usually advised to replace them more often.


# Tools you're gonna need
* basic toolkit, in my case, we need the Torx bits.
* spark plug socket - one that will hold the spark plug so that it doesn't fall out, you can also get away with a normal longer socket (16mm in this case)
* socket extension - the spark plugs are placed low in the head so you're not gonna fit you're wrench directly
* torque wrench - if you can't feel the difference between 10Nm and 15Nm by hand, please get one (you're really gonna need it)

# How to do it
Start by removing the engine cover or whatever is blocking the access to the coils. In the case of my 
Twin Spark engine it is the silver/red cover. To unscrew it you're gonna need a Torx bit.

Underneath it you will see the ingition coils with wires attached to it. You can undo all of the connectors.

Then you can remove the bolts holding the metal plate to which the coils are mounted (or whatever is holding them in your car).
In the case of the Twin Spark you can use the same Torx bit as for the cover (2 screws in the center and 2 on the edges).

Pull the coils out and you can see the spark plugs screwed into the engine head.

Now use your spark plug socket and remove unscrew them. Put the new ones in place, paying attention to how it goes into the thread. 
The last thing you want is to damage it, then you're gonna have to rethread it or get a new one.

Use your torque wrench to tighten all of them to the specified torque. In my case it is 25Nm-35Nm for the bigger plugs and 10Nm-12Nm for the smaller ones, 
which is also indicated on a sticker on top of the valve cover. 

After you're done just reconnect the ignition coils and put everything back together in reverse order.
