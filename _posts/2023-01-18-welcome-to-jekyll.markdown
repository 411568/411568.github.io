![Our team](/assets/images/bitehack_main_image.jpg)

On 14/15th of January we - Michał Nizioł, Marek Pawłowski, Dominik Michalczyk and me - participated in BITEhack, in the robotic category.
Our task was to build a robot in 24h using parts given to us by the organizers. The main topic we were given was: "Survival in extreme situations".
